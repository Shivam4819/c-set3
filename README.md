These are the programs of array written in c++.

1)An array  contain both possitive and negative number. The job is to seprate them and display the array.
         file->
              main.cpp
              Rearrange.h
              Rearrange.cpp 
       
2)The job is to reverse the content of array and print them in reverse order.
         file->
              ReverseOfArray.h
              ReverseOfArray.cpp      
              
3)The job is to print the content of array in wave form. 
         file->
              WaveForm.h
              WaveForm.cpp
       
4)An array is given.There will be two values lowvalue and highvalue , the job is to place all element low then lowvalue at start of array  then the value between lowvalue and highvalue will be palced and at last the element greater then the highvalue.
         file->
              PartioningOfArray.h                               
              PartioningOfArray.cpp
        
5)The job is to arrange all possitive element at first and negative element at last.The order of the element should not be changed.
         file->
              NegativeElemToEnd.h
              NegativeElemToEnd.cpp
